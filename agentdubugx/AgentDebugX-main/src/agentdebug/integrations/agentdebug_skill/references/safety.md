# Safety Rules

- AgentDebugX skill wrappers and recovery outputs are suggest-only by default.
- Never apply patches, rerun a failing agent, publish bundles, or mutate a
  workspace without explicit user approval.
- Do not download or execute remote install scripts from a skill.
- Redact secrets before sharing trajectories outside the local machine.
- Prefer deterministic `diagnose` before LLM-backed `judge` or `deep`.
- Do not silently inspect host-local private state to find trajectories.
- Use `diagnose --mode judge` or `diagnose --mode deep`; do not rely on removed
  public `agentdebug judge` / `agentdebug deep` command forms.
