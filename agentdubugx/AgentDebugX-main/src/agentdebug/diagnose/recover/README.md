# Recover

Recover is the third Diagnose stage. It turns attributed root causes into
repair strategies that can be reviewed by a user or consumed by Rerun.

## When to use

Use Recover when the system needs to answer: "What should we try next?"

Typical strategies include:

- Reflexion-style retry guidance
- CRITIC-style feedback
- Self-Refine instructions
- DeepDebug recovery prompts
- AutoManual recovery plans
- Saga rollback suggestions

## Flow

1. Receive a `DiagnoseContext` containing detector findings and primary
   attribution.
2. Use the primary attribution as the recovery target. Fall back to detector
   findings only when attribution is unavailable or cannot be grounded to a
   trajectory event.
3. Select one or more recovery strategies.
4. Generate candidate recovery actions or rerun directives.
5. Preserve evidence and assumptions so the user can audit the recommendation.
6. Carry the selected proposal, Detect findings, and primary Attribution result
   into the bounded diagnostic context of the `RerunRequest`.

Self-Refine requests JSON-constrained critic and refined-action fields. Each
stage validates `finish_reason`, JSON parsing, the required field, and sentence
completeness. A truncated or invalid response is retried once with an expanded
token budget; repeated failure produces deterministic guidance from the
finding instead of exposing partial model text. Gateways that reject
`response_format` automatically fall back to prompt-constrained JSON.

## Dependencies

Template-based recovery can run locally. LLM-guided recovery requires configured
model access. Workflow-specific recovery modes may depend on benchmark or
executor context supplied later by Rerun.

Recovery never executes the proposal. `requires_human_approval` is portable
policy metadata for the integrating deployment; callers must enforce their own
authorization policy before dispatching a live Rerun executor.

## Extension Rules

- Register new recovery components with `diagnose/component_manifests/recover/`.
- Keep recovery outputs explicit about assumptions, scope, and expected effect.
- Do not execute external systems from Recover. Execution belongs to Rerun.
- Preserve compatibility with existing recovery mode names.
